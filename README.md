# Distributed Quantum Circuit (DQC) Optimization via Integer Programming

This program proposes an efficient approach for solving the **Distributed Quantum Circuit (DQC)** problem using **integer programming**. Unlike hypergraph partitioning methods, it is designed to optimize ebit cost under fixed module assignment.

---

## Features

- **Integer Programming-Based Optimization**:
  - Provides better ebit usage strategies for distributed quantum circuit problems.

---

## Main Functions

- **Module Post-Processing**:
  - Includes post-processing capabilities to minimize ebit consumption after partitioning.

---

## How to Use

```bash
python3 main.py  # Run example of DQC partitioning and optimization
